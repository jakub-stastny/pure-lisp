* About

PureLisp is a programming language that runs on any WebAssembly-enabled platform that's meant for writing platform-independent tools, which can be used on any platform.

It is a 100% functional programming language and as such it has no mutable data and no side effects.

Before you start to wonder whether this is April fools' joke, let me explain: you don't need any side effects in PureLisp, because the host platform can provide them.

* Why?

Domain specific languages are seriously underrated. If someone wants to design a programming language, they nearly always go for a generic purpose programming language.

It seems to make sense, after all why shouldn't you be able to write anything in such language.

But the reality is more intricate than that and specialisation in many cases does pay off.

Take Elm for instance: it made its trade-offs and because of them it's an absolutely amazing language for writing web apps.

And this is what PureLisp is trying to accomplish for multi-platform data libraries.

* Multiplatform code

Back in the days you could write an app in C and make it run on any platform. It would have a lot of platform specific code (especially for implementing the GUI), but it was totally possible.

Then the mobile platform came and suddenly you can only write in Swift or Objective C for iOS, ......... how is it on Android? Is Kotlin enforced or can you use any language? After all, it's Linux.

This complicates everything and makes development more expensive.

So someone comes and says "F-it! Let's write in HTML/CSS/JS and let's just have a WebView wrappers for them."

And it works. You have your hybrid app and it runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, it runs on iOS and it runs on Android.

But something's off. It just doesn't look right. It doesn't behave right either. And it's missing the wow factor of a good iOS app. Not mention that it's not the fastest thing in the universe either.

Having to write native UI for each platform is just the way it is if you want your app to be any good. There are some exceptions that managed to get away with the hybrid approach, but they are few and far between.

So then? Do we have to always port /everything/ to every supported platform?

Well, no!

Write the platform-specific UI in whatever language is required by the platform, but write the logic in something that runs anywhere.

Enter PureLisp.

* Features

** Write once, run anywhere

What Java didn't manage to deliver, WebAssembly did. And since PureLisp is written for the WebAssembly platform, you get all the benefits.

Namely you can run PureLisp in a browser, within an iOS/iPadOS app and on the server by embedding it into runtime of your choice (Rust, Node.js, Ruby, you name it).

** 100% secure

Since WebAssembly runtime is sandboxed and there are no OS bindings, there is no way to access the file system from PureLisp (there is from the host language of course) and there is no way to run external commands, execute OS syscalls or fetch data from the internet.

Sure, we could use WASI that wants to fill the gap, but that's just not the way we want to go about this.

** Functional programming

** No runtime exceptions

*** TODO: Brainstorm this

We won't have =Errno::ENOENT=s flying around, but there's always programmer's error, say passing wrong arguments =(+ 1 "2").

I think these could be (all?) checked on compile time.

** Virtual FS

Same idea as virtual DOM in React.js or Elm.

Since there are no side effects, reading or writing files is not possible in PureLisp.

Fortunately there's a simple workaround, that's totally FP-friendly.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(expose (function generate-from-scratch (sources-vfs) (
  (mkvfs (
    (map (glob sources-vfs "*.org")
         lambda (stream) (generate-blog-post stream)))))))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
function main() {
  const blogPostSources = VirtualFS.read('~/blog', {pattern: '**/*.org') // Or: ignore: '**/*.swp', or: gitignore: true.
  // This construct an object:
  // {root: true, type: 'directory', entries: [{type: 'directory', name: 'src', entries: [...]}, {{type: 'file', name: 'README.org', content: "..."}]}
  const outputVFS = pureLispRuntime.generate(blogPostSources, blogPostOutput)
  outputVFS.commit('output')
}
#+END_SRC

If we need some initial state of the virtual FS, we need to provide that from the host language:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
function main() {
  const blogPostSources = VirtualFS.read('~/blog')
  const blogPostOutput = VirtualFS.open('output')
  const updatedVirtualFS = pureLispRuntime.generate(blogPostSources, blogPostOutput)
  updatedVirtualFS.commit()
}
#+END_SRC

** Concurrency and UI tools of your choice

There's no need for locks, since there are no mutable data.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
function main() {
  const blogPostSources = VirtualFS.read('~/blog')
  const vdirectories = blogPostSources.glob(/^\d{4}\//).map(vdirectory => {
    const thread = new Thread()
      thread.execute(() => {
      blogPostAPI.generate(vdirectory)
    })
  })
  
  vdirectories.forEach(vdir => vdir.commit())
}
#+END_SRC

** Testing

If the logic is clearly separated from side effects, testing is easy!

I don't think testing the UI and sideeffects is all that useful. It's typically slow (think automating the browser), platform-specific (think IE vs FF) and often just impossible.

Test your logic thoroughly and just click through the app to see that the platform-specific code works.

** Macros and reader macros

** Namespaces

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(export (function test() (puts "Hello world!"))
(export (const contact-email "joe@doe.com"))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(import { test } from custom-functions) ; Will fail to compile if there's no test.
(import * as helpers from myorg.tools.helpers)
#+END_SRC

? Should I support default exports ?

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(export default (function test() (puts "Hello world!"))
#+END_SRC

It makes sense in OOP, where you export the whole class. But here it may or may not be useful. Yet â€“ I'm not saying no, after all, you can export a high order function that wraps every other function in the file. So probably it makes sense.

** Data types and polymorphism

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(type Triangle (point-a point-b point-c))
(type Circle (central-point size))

(generic draw (object)
  (:documentation "Draws a geometrical object"))
  
(method draw (object Triangle) (...))
(method draw (object Circle) (...))
#+END_SRC

* Design decisions

** Embedded programming language

/PureLisp is not a generic programming language./

This is the most important thing to keep in mind.

There are bunch of things it doesn't do:

- It can't run external commands.
- It has no bindings to low-level

* Examples

** Basic example

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(expose (function load-post (org-mode-string) (...)))
(expose (function generate-json (post) (...)))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
function main() {
  await const pureLispRuntime = loadModule('pure-lisp-runtime.wasm')
  const blogGeneratorAPI = pureLispRuntime.loadByteCode(<compiled-from-the-lisp-code-from-above>)

  blogGeneratorAPI.generateJson(
    blogGeneratorAPI.loadPost(File.read(<path>))) ; <- We avoided side functions in PureLisp!
}
#+END_SRC

** Example with user-defined functions

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
; User defined script.
(entry 1/6/2021 (
  (budget cw:1200 - b:200)))

(entry 7/6/2021 (
  (budget cw:1200 - b:200)))
#+END_SRC

This will need some help to expand it to:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
; We end up with a list of entries.
((mkentry "1/6/2021" (budget "cw:1200 - b:200"))
 (mkentry "7/6/2021" (budget "cw:1200 - b:200")))
#+END_SRC

So we need to load all the statements as one list. That way we can implement everything in pure functions, avoiding having to do `@entries ||= Array.new` and `@entries << entry`.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
; Developer provided macros.
(macro entry (date properties) (...))

(load-s-expressions (read vfs "custom-functions.lisp"))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
function main() {
  await const pureLispCompiler = loadModule('pure-lisp-compiler.wasm)
  await const pureLispRuntime = loadModule('pure-lisp-runtime.wasm')

  pureLispRuntime.loadByteCode(pureLispCompiler.load(<macro-module-code>))
  const entries = pureLispRuntime.loadByteCodeAsList(pureLispCompiler.load(<user-defined-code>))
}
#+END_SRC
