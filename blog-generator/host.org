#+TITLE:  Blog generator host integration
#+AUTHOR: Jakub Šťastný

* Host
** Node.js bindings

Run as a command-line program.

*Usage:* =$0 [blog-post-sources] [output-directory]=

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
function main(args) {
  const outputVFS = pureLispRuntime.generate(
    vfs.read(args[0], {pattern: '**/*.org'}))

  outputVFS.commit(args[1])
}
#+END_SRC

** iOS/iPadOS bindings

*** TODO How would it work?

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
#+END_SRC

** Browser bindings

*** TODO How would it work?

Potentially it could use say GH API to write the files. Or =localStorage=, but having posts in there would be rather useless.
